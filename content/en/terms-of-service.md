# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (we'll just call it "the Site" or "us"). Before you dive into our services, please take a moment to read through these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're agreeing to and accepting these terms. Awesome! ✨

## 1. Service Introduction
**The Site** offers users awesome paid subscription content and membership services. This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, ebooks, and community interactions. Just a heads-up, some content is only available to our subscribed members.

## 2. User Registration and Accounts
*   **Users** need to provide a valid email address and set up a password to register for an account. Easy peasy!
*   **Users** are totally responsible for their account's security and all activities under it. Seriously, **don't** transfer or share your account with anyone else. 🔒
*   **The Site** reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they violate these terms. Play nice, folks!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   **Subscription services** are billed monthly/annually, with fees clearly displayed on the checkout page. No surprises!
*   **All payments** are handled via third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Don't worry, **the Site** doesn't store your payment info.
*   **Subscriptions** will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends. Keep an eye on that calendar! 🗓️
*   **Our 14-Day Refund Policy** is simple: First-time subscribers, if you're not totally satisfied with the service within 14 days of purchase, you can request a full refund. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're unhappy. This is a one-time deal per user. After 14 days, or for non-first-time subscribers, payments are **non-refundable** unless legally required.

## 4. Content Use and Intellectual Property
*   **All original content** is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without authorization. That's a big no-no.
*   **Users** get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right** to access content for personal learning and reading only. It's all yours for personal use! 🤓
*   **If you need** to use content for commercial purposes or extensive citation, please reach out to **the Site** to get permission. We're usually pretty cool about it!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   **It's strictly forbidden** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights. Let's keep things respectful and legal! 🚫
*   **It's also a big no-no** to bulk download, crawl, or crack member content using technical means. Seriously, don't even try it.
*   **The Site** has the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban rule-breaking users**. Consider yourself warned! 🔨

## 6. Service Changes and Interruptions
*   **We** reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Think of it as evolving! 🚀
*   **If due to** force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions, content becomes temporarily unavailable, **the Site** **will not be held liable for compensation**. It's just how the tech cookie crumbles sometimes.

## 7. Disclaimer
*   **The information provided by the Site** is purely for reference and **doesn't constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical, etc.). Don't take it as gospel!
*   **For any direct or indirect losses** users might incur from using **the Site's** content or services, **the Site** **will not be held responsible**. Just sayin'!

## 8. Governing Law
*   **These Terms of Service** are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Keepin' it legal! ⚖️
*   **Any disputes** arising from or related to these terms will first be resolved through friendly negotiation. If that doesn't work out, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California.
