### Use of Your Personal Data
The Company might use Personal Data for the following purposes: ✨

-   **To provide and maintain our Service**, this includes keeping an eye on how our Service is being used.
-   **To manage your Account**: This involves handling your registration as a user of the Service. The Personal Data you provide gives you access to various features available to you as a registered user.

-   **To contact you**: We might reach out to you via email, telephone calls, SMS, or other equivalent electronic communication forms (like push notifications from a mobile app) to share updates or informative communications related to functionalities, products, or contracted services, including security updates, when such contact is necessary or reasonable.
-   **To provide you with news**, special offers, and general info about other goods, services, and events we offer that are similar to what you've already bought or inquired about, unless you've opted not to get such info.
-   **To manage your requests**: This involves processing and handling the requests you make to Us.
-   **For business transfers**: We might use your information to evaluate or execute a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets. This could be as a continuing concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceedings, in which Personal Data held by Us about our Service users is among the assets transferred.
-   **For other purposes**: We may use your information for other cool stuff like data analysis, pinpointing usage trends, figuring out the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns, and to evaluate and improve our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience.

We might share your personal information in these scenarios:

-   **With your consent**: We may spill your personal information for any other purpose if you give us the green light.

### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will only hold onto your Personal Data for as long as it's needed for the purposes laid out in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to meet our legal obligations (like if we're required to keep your data to comply with applicable laws), sort out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also keep Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally kept for a shorter period, unless it's used to boost the security or improve the functionality of our Service, or we're legally bound to hold onto this data for extended periods.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your information, including Personal Data, is processed at the Company's operating offices and any other spots where the parties involved in the processing are located. This means this info might get transferred to—and hang out on—computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction, where data protection laws might differ from yours.

Your consent to this Privacy Policy, followed by your submission of such information, gives us the green light for that transfer.

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. No transfer of your Personal Data will happen to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal information.

### Delete Your Personal Data
You have the right to delete or ask for our help in deleting the Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might let you delete certain info about you right from within the Service itself.

You can update, amend, or wipe out your info anytime by logging into your Account (if you've got one) and heading over to the account settings section that lets you manage your personal information. You can also give us a shout to request access to, correct, or delete any personal information you've given us.

But hold up, we might need to hang onto certain info when we've got a legal obligation or a lawful basis to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets into a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law enforcement
In certain situations, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if legally required to do so, or in response to valid requests by public authorities (like a court or a government agency).

#### Other legal requirements
The Company might drop your Personal Data, believing in good faith that such action is necessary to:

-   Comply with a legal obligation
-   Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
-   Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
-   Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
-   Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of your Personal Data is super important to us! 🔒 But hey, remember, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is ever 100% foolproof. While we bust our butts to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security.

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly scoop up personally identifiable information from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your child has given us Personal Data, please hit us up. If we find out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we'll take steps to delete that info from our servers.

If we need to lean on consent as a legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might ask for your parent's consent before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll get whisked away to that third-party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit. ⚠️

We have zero control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy
We might tweak our Privacy Policy now and then. We'll give you a heads-up about any changes by posting the fresh Privacy Policy right here on this page. 📝

Before the changes kick in, we'll let you know via email and/or a super noticeable heads-up on our Service, and we'll update the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

It's a good idea to peep this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they're posted on this page.
